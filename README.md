# Bluetooth-floor-Cleaner
Arduino based floor cleaning robot that is controlled by bluetooth  app from android phone
can be controlled by phone or be set in auto mode. still the auto mode still has a bit of work to be done. it just moves around assuming the room to be divided into an m x n matrix for now. open to suggestions to make this even better
